# Printify Profit Calculator

Selling print-on-demand products through platforms like Printify can be a great business model, but understanding the true costs and profit margins can be challenging. This handy web app aims to make it easy to calculate your real profits. 

The [Printify Profit Calculator](https://gitstudying.github.io/PrintifyProfitCalculator/) allows you to input your production costs, shipping costs, retail price and VAT/sales tax rate. It will then calculate your net profit margin. This gives you visibility into how pricing impacts your bottom line.

The calculator currently supports Printify but could be extended to support other major print-on-demand platforms in the future. Comparing profitability across platforms could be very useful, especially when starting out. More established sellers often have the luxury to choose the cheapest provider.
