# PrintifyProfitCalculator
Print on demand is quite a big business right now and I personally have seen a lot of people using Printify and then often and Etsy site attached to it. This system works quite well in my opinion but the overview of total (hidden) cost is not there. So for myself and for anyone wanting to have a better idea of what pricing they should use please feel free to use the [PrintifyProfitCalculator site, try it yourself!](https://gitstudying.github.io/PrintifyProfitCalculator/).
As there are more platforms and might want to compare or calculate the profits for other platlforms, this is a work in progress.

# Future implementation ideas
- Possibility to extend to other big selling platforms as it would be a more general tool.
- Compare multiple or two plaforms, or even calculate the cheapest platform of the implemented ones. As a starting seller this could be handy. If you are more popular or higher selling but gain a lot of traffic from your own sources or affiliate marketing then you could just choose the cheapest platform and sell your items there.
- Calculate breakeven cost from inputs (depending on the platform cost and logic requires a lot of rewriting of equations and finally solving them)
