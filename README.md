# PrintifyEtsyCalculator
Print on demand is quite a big business right now and I personally have seen a lot of people using Printify and then often and Etsy site attached to it. This system works quite well in my opinion but the overview of total (hidden) cost is not there. So for myself and for anyone wanting to have a better idea of what pricing they should use please feel free to use the [PrintifyEtsyCalculator site, try it yourself!](https://gitstudying.github.io/PrintifyEtsyCalculator/)

# Future implementation ideas
- Improve usability for public as the description are not specific enough to be clear
- Calculate breakeven cost from inputs
- Improve website styling as there is currently no styling
